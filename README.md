# See live site:

Visit [the live site here](https://joshuaskootsky.github.io/chuyu-tian/ 'Chuyu Tian Academic Portfolio'), hosted on GitHub pages. You can check out the deploy script for how it uses the worktree in git to keep track of the code that generates the website, while the assets are generated in a seperate branch.

# Built with Hugo

This website was built with Hugo - check them out! [https://gohugo.io/]. Because Hugo turns Markdown into pages, and because script tags in HTMl are valid Markdown... it is possible to write JavaScript for these static site generators.
