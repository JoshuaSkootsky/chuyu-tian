## Academic Mission Statement

I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in philosophy at Columbia University. I work mainly in Ancient philosophy and metaethics, with interest in Chinese philosophy. My dissertation aims to answer whether Aristotle is a particularist. I am also the rapporteur for the Neo-Confucianism Seminar at Columbia.
