The aim of my dissertation is to investigate the justificatory status of rules in Aristotle’s ethics.

Based on Aristotle's ethical corpus, I develop a model of ethical justification — a model where natural laws are summary of actions directly grounded by the good life, while conventional laws justify actions and are in turn justified by the good life — to offer a plausible explanation for the meta-ethical status of laws in Aristotle’s ethics.
