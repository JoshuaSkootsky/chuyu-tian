The aim of my dissertation is to investigate the justificatory status of rules in Aristotle’s ethics.

How does Aristotle’s ethics differ from a rule-based one? In my dissertation, I clarify the meta-ethical status of ethical judgments and investigate the foundation of Aristotle’s ethics.

In the first two chapters, I argue for a person-centric account of Aristotle’s ethics. The virtuous person is not only an exemplar with unique epistemic access to ethically salient particulars, but a measure of what is good to human beings: the virtuous person, qua in a well-ordered, harmonious state, defines what is good for a human being.

For the rest of my dissertation, I inquire into the foundation of Aristotle’s ethics. In my third chapter, I argue against both Terence Irwin’s scientific explanation and John McDowell’s self-explanatory coherentism. Instead, ethics is political. 

In my fourth chapter, I extend my constitutive account to virtue politics. The virtuous person is the measure not just in ethics but also in politics. I will argue that “πολιτικὸν ζῷον” means any good person should want to live as a full-fledged citizen in a state that provides not just necessities but also conditions for cultivating and exercising virtue in collective self-governance. Justice involves more than having laws, but involves a shared understanding of the right kind of relationships by reference to a reasonable political order that nourishes a flourishing life. A political order without that goal is failing as a political order.

This raises the question: is Aristotle’s ethics prior to his politics, or vice versa? Does a good human life ground a good political constitution or the other way around? In Chapter Five, I first present the Basic Picture, in which the ideal constitution is determined by a conception of the best human life. The telos of a polis is ultimately good human lives. The Subtler Picture of what I term Proportional Political Organicism, however, questions how common is the common good. Even in an ideal polis, not everyone is expected to be virtuous qua human; the virtues of women and slaves are defined by their social roles, in ways that only make sense relative to the specific political arrangement. The abstract “Man” to be actualized within the network of paradigmatic free and equal citizenship is a socio-economically conditioned one. 

Reflecting from a meta-textual perspective, I contend that Aristotle’s political treatise is itself perspectival. His politics starts from the “we” of a privileged citizenry. I conclude that Aristotle’s constitutional objectivism ostensibly says ethics precedes politics, but his ethics is preceded by the “common" good of a qualified “we”, and is therefore preceded by politics in this very sense. Ultimately, his politics is prior to his ethics.
