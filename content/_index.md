## About Me

I am a fifth year PhD student in Philosophy at Columbia University. My research focuses on Aristotleâ€™s ethics, and includes such topics as: Aristotelian reasoning, akrasia, and particularism. I also have interests in classical East Asian and South Asian philosophy. I am a co-organizer of the [Columbia Non-western Philosophy Reading Group](https://nonwesternphilosophy.wordpress.com) and served as the rapporteur for Columbia Neo-Confucianism Seminar. Check out the menu bar to learn more about my research and teaching.

I grew up in Beijing and received my B.A. with honors from Northwestern University. I wrote my honors thesis comparing the ideas of community in Confucius and Aristotle. In my spare time, I enjoy translating poems, visiting museums, painting, and dancing.
